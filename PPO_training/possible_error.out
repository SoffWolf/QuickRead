0  I was 14, it was my first semester of high school, and the only male student in my class of thirty people. Now, theoretically, this should be the perfect opportunity for my 14 year old self to get a girlfriend. I would be the only guy they could be interested in. "like shooting fish in a barrel," i told myself. Maybe i was lucky, or just in the violent throes of puberty, but almost every girl in that class was gorgeous. At first it was just a bit of a novelty, funny and somewhat exciting. \n There was nowhere to go but down . The girls who knew me from middle school weren't interested and they didn't help my case with the other girls. I don't know what exactly started it (it's possible i may have been ogling, I couldn't tell you with absolute certainty that i didn't), but they started treating me like an athiest in church. glaring at the back of my head, thousand yard stares whenever i was around, etc. Thankfully for my self esteem i didn't notice until the next semester(because, you know, boobs everywhere). I was 14, and as such, i had nothing that anyone anywhere would call game. I got attention from 1 girl and i fucked that up. To top it all off, i was so distracted that i barely passed the class with a D-. At the time, the whole experience felt like striking out at T-ball.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
1  It won't help. \nA dispatcher needs to send your call to either fire, medical or police dispatch. On their side they have computer prompts normally. They can't even write down your address until prompted to. And the first person you talk to usually is not the dispatcher who will even handle the input. \nBut then again, every city, yes city has a different system for emergency response. \n A 911 call is short. It seems like an eternity to you, but the way calls are taken is the result of 40 years of international studies on this, it does not waste time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
2  I'm a female nursing student so most of my program is other females. I find it hard to make good friends with other girls in general. The only good girl friends I have are from kindergarten and they live in my hometown. My university is in a different city so I don't have many friends here. I tend to go out with my sister and her friends. I am in third year so everyone already has a set group of friends. \n They only time I see people in my program is during class and I know most of them stick to certain groups. I am kinda friends with some students but I only really talk to them in class I don;t see them outside of school. How to I join one of these groups so I can start going out with them to bars and stuff?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
3  This girl I have been talking to for solid a 2 months now is saying she is too stressed to deal with us. when she was perfectly fine the the week before. Its like she just flipped the switch or something. \n We aren't dating yet and she said she would message or talk to me when she is ready. Every thing was fine and now I have no idea what is wrong. \n Obviously we fight a little but nothing too serious. So we have not spoken in a week or so. Then I sent her a letter and flowers +  chocolate in attempt to get her to at least say anything. \n The letter told her it would be nice to talk again and not to stress over what we have. She still has not spoken to me and I have no idea what is going on. \n Does she want to end it? She has not said anything about ending it because she won''t even talk to me and I am the only one putting in effort. I am extremely confused. \n So is she waiting for me to end it or what? I am so lost. I don't want to end it but I am literally sitting here because I don't want to make anything worse. I am giving her space but if she wants to end it she won't even tell me. So what do i do. I am pretty much out of options. Any suggestions would be very helpful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
4  X/post from dating advice]\nSo last week I started talking to a guy from a dating site. He seemed really interested in getting to know me(we had a lot in common) when we chatted on the site and after a bit he gave me his number. Started texting for a bit, then he asked me out for dinner(This would have been Saturday or Sunday. So cool, he picks me up and we head to the restaurant on the day we planned(Tuesday). \n Honestly, it was a liiiittle awkward. Especially when he drove me back home. We talked a little bit in his car and it got a little awkward than the guy suddenly unbuckles his set belt, and reaches over me to give me the quickest hug and kiss I've every gotten. \n Despite the bumpy first date, I decided to give him a second chance and asked him if he wanted to do something Saturday.He agreed and the next day I invited to a party someone from work was hosting. He agreed and during the time between when I asked him(Wednesday) and the party on Saturday he would text me everyday right after I would be done work to ask how work was and later what I was doing that night(he still does this now). \n Saturday comes and we're a lot more comfortable with each other. I ended up having a ton of fun with him at the party! Afterward he walked me home and I offer to let him stay the night as I didn't want him to drive home after drinking(and yes, I was planning on sleeping with him if he wanted to). \n To my surprise he turns my offer down and tells me maybe another time. A was pretty disappointed and actually really surprised. I figured if it was any other guy and he would have been through my door before I finished my sentence! \n Anyways, he texts me when I go inside, nothing important. The next day I figured he maybe is not attracted to me or interested but he ended up texting me, asking me how my Sunday is going and he texted me again today. \n Sooo over all I'm very confused on what is going through this guy's head. I figure, if he's really not into me, why bother asking about my day every freakin day like clock-work? He seems like he doesn't wanna just hit it and quit it, cause he had that chance and didn't take it. He hasn't made plans with me, but still contacts me everyday. \n I don't get it, what's he's deal? Is he playing games or just weird/awkward/shy?? Is he wasting my time and should I just start ignoring him or what? Anyone else go through this shit?                                                                                                                                                                                                     0

1  It's best to follow their prompts since that is how they take calls. And besides, location is the third thing they ask after type of call, and phone number.

22016  Not a locksmith, but I worked at a hardware store where my jobs included copying keys, rekeying locks, and once in a while picking a lock or two for the school district. \n One morning the top local fish and wildlife cop, Frank, stops in. "Just had a guy quit and he didn't turn in his truck keys. I had spare door and ignition keys, but none for the toolboxes. Mind having a look?" I look: "It'll take you all afternoon to get the old ones out, and the new ones will be almost a hundred bucks, Frank. Call your guy and get the keys, or get a locksmith." He tells me the guy just vanished, about all the paperwork he'd have to fill out for lost or stolen keys, then more to hold the costs from the ex-officer's last paycheck, plus rekeying all the other locks he may or may not have had keys to, etc, etc.. "Can't you do anything?" "Fine. I'll see if I can pick one and make you a key, a blank is only a dollar." \n I pick one and make a key that works in it. We go back out to the truck to check it against the other locks. Frank looks through as I open them all. "You any good at lock-boxes?", he shouts. "Hunh?" "Numbnuts left a lock-box in here, probably full of ammo." "You can open that yourself with a screwdriver. C'mon, you can borrow one from the back." \n We head to the back room and Frank sets to prying it open. Pop! And what do we find? A small scale, a wad of bills, and several big baggies of pot. "Aww, shit."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
22017  I'm 33, and I've been told it's time to "grow up" by like every girl I have ever dated.  When I was in college I had my share of random hookups, and to be perfectly honest I'd trade it all to have those same opportunities again. \n When you're out of college... the random hookups always seem sad, lame.  There's just nothing like finding a hot college freshmen at a fraternity party and bringing her up to your room for some fun, and largely anonymous, sex.  For me, that's the ideal.  When the only effort it took was, "Hey, I got you a drink." \n But you try that same thing with a chick who is in her late 20s... and it's... well for me it's just nowhere near the same.  Like that feeling that it was a something "new" is gone.  It's just not as energetic, and they want more than just a free beer, y'know? \n I've been with my current girlfriend for almost 5 years.  I'm 33, she's 24.  I've cheated on her a few times, mostly with prostitutes.  She doesn't know.  When I met her she was smoking hot, carefree, and a blast to be with.  And mostly she still is all of those things.  She's the only girl I've ever had sex with for more than a month and still wanted to have more sex with.  I can't see myself with anyone else right now, but... I'm not ready to marry her either. \n She started working last year, put on like 10 pounds since she graduated, and I don't think she likes her job much.  Recently she started talking about moving in with me, and she's been getting more pushy about relationship talks and kids.  I don't want to have kids any time soon -- my dad was 45 before he had kids, that's more of what I'm aiming for.  I make a great living, but I'm not ready to start sharing my life decisions with her. \n So... I know I need to grow up.  Right?  How do you guys deal with this stuff?  I don't want her to move in with me.  I don't want to hurt her, she's been a good girl.  I would rather not lose her and have to find someone else, but is it just selfish of me?  I get that you can't stay 18 forever, but mostly just curious how other guys have handled their relationships.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
22018  We've been casually seeing each other for about 2 to 2.5 years. We started out working together but after almost a year I moved on to bigger and better things. We still maintained our "relationship" (for lack of a better word) although it wasn't anything serious. \n About a year after we started seeing each other, I discovered that he was hitting on multitudes of girls and decided to cut him loose. I was hurt and felt that I was being strung along. After 5 months of no contact, he reappears and is absolutely hung up over having not seen me. He desperately and obsessively tries to get us back into some sort of relationship, and eventually I gave in. \n We officially started back up in January of this year. We're still not exclusive yet but he's throwing me in for a loop here. \n Within the past month \nI felt like he was putting distance between us. We sometimes could text for hours, even without talking about sex. I felt a true connection to him and began to feel like I loved him. \n I got another job offer from his company and decided to take it and since then, he's been laying low and taking hours to respond to me, if at all. I got really frustrated with him and called him out on it, but he claims that he's just got a lot of things going on and he's busy at work. I don't know if I really believe all of that, it just sounds like an excuse. He's never blown me off before, but he's done it twice now in the span of a month. \n So, I asked for a break. Apparently he didn't like that because as soon as I asked for that he purposefully tried to upset me by hitting one one of my friends right in front of me. I decided to go completely no contact after that. He knows that he did a very hurtful thing because when we work together he shoots me sorrowful and longing glances. He'll talk me up about my day and other sorts of things. He's being perfectly fine now, but I'm still reeling. \n I broke no contact and texted him to which he replied and wanted to meet up. However, he didn't end up making it because he took a really long nap after he got off of work. He wanted to make it up to me at an unspecified time. He hasn't contacted me since then and and that was 2 days ago. \n I'm honestly very lost. I know he sounds like a massive ass in this post but it's his fucking sad eyes that get me every damned time. I need help on deciding what to do with this relationship. If more information is needed, I can provide!
22019  Background:  My SO and I live pretty close to a beach which after dark is more or less completely empty, and I'm talking a huge peninsula so it's not just like a small little lake.  They have the occasional park patrol that tosses people out after dark and we had been there long enough to realize it was completely abandoned and DARK, I mean really dark. \n So she says we should skinny dip, I say sure lets do this.  Then it becomes a theoretical but "what if" conversation.  In short who can give some advice on how to do go skinny dipping and minimize the risks of getting caught by some passerby or park ranger?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
22020  I was diagnosed with chronic migraines a week before my 21st birthday in March of 2009. Since then my life has been a total mess, unable to take a full course load at college (and even with a reduced load still not being able to do the work properly). I tried to work a part time, unpaid internship in 2010 and was barely able to make it to work for the 20 hours a week I was supposed to (I may have fudged my numbers a bit to make it work). Crippling pain every day (yes-- every day-- I haven't had a headache free day in about 3 years), etc. etc. \n So, now I have realized there is no job I can do. I can't work a brainless minimum wage job because I am in too much pain too often-- I would never make it to my shift. I can't work a real job because I would never make it there and I can't think very clearly anyway. I can't work from home because my eyes break way too often (I wanted to be a copyeditor, but I can't focus my eyes closely enough to find errors anymore). I want to apply for Social Security Disability, but I don't know how I qualify. Since I was diagnosed before age 22 I may qualify as a "child adult" but I worked at a movie theatre through high school and early college (prior to disability) and may qualify through "limited work experience". Is there anyone out in Reddit land who can help me figure this stuff out? They make this all so difficult to deter / hinder people trying to "sneak in" or whatever, but it makes it almost impossible for those of us who are in serious pain. \n If you know nothing about disability do you have any suggestions of how to deal with life in crippling pain? I have a severe lack of friends now because nobody understands that I can't just drive myself to a party (or go to a party, booze + music + lights = death migraine).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
22021  We've been working together for about 6 months. I am 22, he is 24. We are both single but neither of us want a serious relationship right now. We flirt back and forth a lot. Today, he proposed that we get drinks, and "let our hair down" together. Basically, he'd like to start a FWB type situation. I have been thinking about this long before he brought it up and I am inclined to agree. We have a lot of sexual chemistry it seems and get along great in general. \n There isn't any "rule" at work that we can't start any sort of relationship so that isn't the issue. I guess I just want some input on if I should go for it, or just leave things as they are. Anyone with experience in this type of area; the good, the bad, the ugly....                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
22022  We have been dating for 3 years, and the past year of our relationship has been long distance because of my job. My work contract is about to end, and I plan to move to be closer to him.  I have been applying for jobs in his city for the past few months, but no luck yet. We decided that once my contract is up, there's no reason to stay here, so I will move to his city and continue searching for a job. \n I want to stay with him until I find a job, and get my own place once I have an income. I do have money saved up, and would expect to split living costs evenly with him while I stay at his place. \n He says he will let me stay with him for up to two weeks. He wants me to find my own place, and has even offered to cosign on a lease if I need it (because no one wants to rent to someone who's unemployed). He's also offered to pay my rent if I run out of savings before I find a job. He lives in a city with a high cost of living, so I'm not super excited about renting while unemployed. \n I am grateful for how much he is willing to help me, but I do think it's odd that he doesn't want me to stay with him. I talked to him about it and he said it's because he's not ready to move in with me yet and he doesn't want to live with me just because it's convenient. I want to respect his feelings and accept his decision, but I'm kind of annoyed. I wouldn't consider staying with him until I find a job "moving in together." It would be a temporary situation. I think he's making a bigger deal out of this than it really is, and he thinks I'm making a smaller deal out of this than it really is. \n Can you help me understand his perspective?
