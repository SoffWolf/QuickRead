0  I was 14, it was my first semester of high school, and the only male student in my class of thirty people. Now, theoretically, this should be the perfect opportunity for my 14 year old self to get a girlfriend. I would be the only guy they could be interested in. "like shooting fish in a barrel," i told myself. Maybe i was lucky, or just in the violent throes of puberty, but almost every girl in that class was gorgeous. At first it was just a bit of a novelty, funny and somewhat exciting. \n There was nowhere to go but down . The girls who knew me from middle school weren't interested and they didn't help my case with the other girls. I don't know what exactly started it (it's possible i may have been ogling, I couldn't tell you with absolute certainty that i didn't), but they started treating me like an athiest in church. glaring at the back of my head, thousand yard stares whenever i was around, etc. Thankfully for my self esteem i didn't notice until the next semester(because, you know, boobs everywhere). I was 14, and as such, i had nothing that anyone anywhere would call game. I got attention from 1 girl and i fucked that up. To top it all off, i was so distracted that i barely passed the class with a D-. At the time, the whole experience felt like striking out at T-ball.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
1  It won't help. \nA dispatcher needs to send your call to either fire, medical or police dispatch. On their side they have computer prompts normally. They can't even write down your address until prompted to. And the first person you talk to usually is not the dispatcher who will even handle the input. \nBut then again, every city, yes city has a different system for emergency response. \n A 911 call is short. It seems like an eternity to you, but the way calls are taken is the result of 40 years of international studies on this, it does not waste time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
2  I'm a female nursing student so most of my program is other females. I find it hard to make good friends with other girls in general. The only good girl friends I have are from kindergarten and they live in my hometown. My university is in a different city so I don't have many friends here. I tend to go out with my sister and her friends. I am in third year so everyone already has a set group of friends. \n They only time I see people in my program is during class and I know most of them stick to certain groups. I am kinda friends with some students but I only really talk to them in class I don;t see them outside of school. How to I join one of these groups so I can start going out with them to bars and stuff?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
3  This girl I have been talking to for solid a 2 months now is saying she is too stressed to deal with us. when she was perfectly fine the the week before. Its like she just flipped the switch or something. \n We aren't dating yet and she said she would message or talk to me when she is ready. Every thing was fine and now I have no idea what is wrong. \n Obviously we fight a little but nothing too serious. So we have not spoken in a week or so. Then I sent her a letter and flowers +  chocolate in attempt to get her to at least say anything. \n The letter told her it would be nice to talk again and not to stress over what we have. She still has not spoken to me and I have no idea what is going on. \n Does she want to end it? She has not said anything about ending it because she won''t even talk to me and I am the only one putting in effort. I am extremely confused. \n So is she waiting for me to end it or what? I am so lost. I don't want to end it but I am literally sitting here because I don't want to make anything worse. I am giving her space but if she wants to end it she won't even tell me. So what do i do. I am pretty much out of options. Any suggestions would be very helpful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
4  X/post from dating advice]\nSo last week I started talking to a guy from a dating site. He seemed really interested in getting to know me(we had a lot in common) when we chatted on the site and after a bit he gave me his number. Started texting for a bit, then he asked me out for dinner(This would have been Saturday or Sunday. So cool, he picks me up and we head to the restaurant on the day we planned(Tuesday). \n Honestly, it was a liiiittle awkward. Especially when he drove me back home. We talked a little bit in his car and it got a little awkward than the guy suddenly unbuckles his set belt, and reaches over me to give me the quickest hug and kiss I've every gotten. \n Despite the bumpy first date, I decided to give him a second chance and asked him if he wanted to do something Saturday.He agreed and the next day I invited to a party someone from work was hosting. He agreed and during the time between when I asked him(Wednesday) and the party on Saturday he would text me everyday right after I would be done work to ask how work was and later what I was doing that night(he still does this now). \n Saturday comes and we're a lot more comfortable with each other. I ended up having a ton of fun with him at the party! Afterward he walked me home and I offer to let him stay the night as I didn't want him to drive home after drinking(and yes, I was planning on sleeping with him if he wanted to). \n To my surprise he turns my offer down and tells me maybe another time. A was pretty disappointed and actually really surprised. I figured if it was any other guy and he would have been through my door before I finished my sentence! \n Anyways, he texts me when I go inside, nothing important. The next day I figured he maybe is not attracted to me or interested but he ended up texting me, asking me how my Sunday is going and he texted me again today. \n Sooo over all I'm very confused on what is going through this guy's head. I figure, if he's really not into me, why bother asking about my day every freakin day like clock-work? He seems like he doesn't wanna just hit it and quit it, cause he had that chance and didn't take it. He hasn't made plans with me, but still contacts me everyday. \n I don't get it, what's he's deal? Is he playing games or just weird/awkward/shy?? Is he wasting my time and should I just start ignoring him or what? Anyone else go through this shit?                                                                                                                                                                                                     0
0  only guy in a class of thirty. it was less like shooting fish in a barrel and more like being a white guy at a black panthers meeting                                                             
1  It's best to follow their prompts since that is how they take calls. And besides, location is the third thing they ask after type of call, and phone number.                                      
2  How to I make friends with people(preferably a group) in a classroom setting - Goal is to go out with them to bars and stuff.                                                                     
3  i am lost on what to do with this girl. She won't talk to me at all and won't say its over but she said says she needs time to think things through. Its been a week so i have no idea what to do.
4  Meet a dude from an online dating site.Had two dates one awkward, one great. He texts me everyday asking about my day but doesn't make plans. Intentions seem really vague and not clear.
