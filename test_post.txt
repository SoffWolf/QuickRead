Ukraine on Saturday condemned Russia for sending a ship to the captured Ukrainian city of Mariupol to load a shipment of metal bound for Russia. 

The Ukrainian parliament's commissioner for human rights Liudmyla Denisova said in a statement that the Russians were "sending 3,000 tons of metal products by the first ship from Mariupol to Rostov-on-Don (in Russia). In addition, for more convenient removal of the loot, the occupiers have begun to restore railway connections in Mariupol and Volnovakha."

Russian state news agency TASS reported Saturday that a Russian ship entered the seaport of Mariupol. It quoted a representative of the port administration as saying the vessel would load 2,700 tons of metal and depart for Rostov-on-Don on Monday.

Denisova claimed that the Mariupol port housed about 200,000 tons of metal and cast iron worth $170 million prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
