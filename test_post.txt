I get a call nearly every week from the phone number 1 (720) 539-6698. I think the number is a credit card scam. The automated message says it is cardholder services and that it can lower the interest rate on your credit card. I pressed 1 to "speak to an agent." When the person picked up I asked what company he worked for and why they continued to call me when I'm on the National Do Not Call Registry, and he hung up. I called back and it went straight to voicemail saying "The mailbox belonging to Mike(?) is full." I'm damn near positive they are more than annoying telemarketers, they are attempting to steal people's financial information.

I already filed a complaint with the [National Do Not Call Registry] but I have a lack of faith in their ability to do anything about the fact that this scumbag is trying to rip people off. It seems like they're more worried about telemarketers than anything. I wouldn't be as up in arms about this if it was just stupid telemarketers, but I'm pissed that there's probably poor people out there getting ripped off. This asshole has been calling for months, but I just hang up. Today I've had it.

What else can I do to make sure this scumbag sees justice?
