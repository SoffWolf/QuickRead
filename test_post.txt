I need advice to help deal with a mini internal crisis. I’m a 24 year old male working as a theatre production manager in Aus. I currently work full time for a company and have so for 3 years. I adore the people and the company and its been an incredible incubator for my professional skill set. It has literally taken me around the world to put on shows with Maybe 3 months spent at home in 2021, the rest on the road. Now the big issue revolves around the stress and workload. It’s absolutely massive and I have been having continuous waves of burnout for a year now. Its gotten to the point that I have had to drop everything to keep up with the hours needed to get the job done, to the complete detriment of friends, family and my athletic goals. We are understaffed dramatically but I don’t know if we will be able to fix that problem as we never seem to fix it after talking about it so much. I also know the opportunity to travel the world is a gift almost impossible to replicate and there is still lots of learning in the current role. But it’s hard to find silver linings when 20 day on and no rest is the norm.

A new job came up in my city that appears to require less hours and travel but I worry I’m throwing something away with a company I have allot of love any loyalty for. Sure my current job is a dream for many but I struggle to feel that when burned out again and again. A big part of my seeking a new job is to get a balance back into my life so I can refocus on my major athletic goals, friends and family again.I’m a human that craves community and has been severely lacking it for the last 6 months. Commuting and my sports give me my glow and I miss them. The new role is still with an amazing company and in the direction I want to work but different you know.

How do you reconcile the feelings of loyalty, love and appreciation you have for a company with the feelings of burnout and exhaustion it leaves you with? Is looking for a new job even a reasonable idea when my current job offers allot of opportunity and chances to travel? How do you reconcile the feeling your going to throw something too good away? How much if this is my youthful delusion I can have a balanced life or not feel exhausted when ever job is a slog really?

Thanks for letting me vent. Really need to think out loud with this stuff x
