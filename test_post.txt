I used to be engaged to my boyfriend about 4 years ago but I broke it off back then because of his family. They went from loving me to offering me money so I would break up with him once they found out he had proposed. I did eventually break up with him, not for money, but because I didn’t want him to be put in a position where he had to choose between me or his family and it was obvious that was how things were going to end up. Since he is extremely close to his family, a big part of me was scared he wouldn’t choose me too, which contributed to my decision to end the relationship.

Last year, I started hanging out with some of my old friends again which meant I saw him again too. At first, he was really angry and upset to see me. After I broke up with him, I refused to talk to him because I knew it would be impossible to stick to my decision if I did so he never really got closure or much of an explanation. He wanted me to give him that closure but I didn’t want to cause problems between him and his family. It felt pointless to tell him after all of this time when it wouldn’t change anything.

He wouldn’t drop it at first but eventually I agreed to go on a date with him and he agreed to never ask me again. He hasn’t asked me since but I know he wants to. Part of me feels like I should tell him now since this isn’t the type of secret I think I should be keeping from him but I also still don’t want to cause issues between him and his family. I’ve seen them again since we got back together, and his mother told me that they’ll have to accept that he isn’t going to let go of me. They’ve also been really nice to me but I don’t know if it’ll last… It definitely won’t if I tell him.

What should I do? And if I do tell him, how should I go about it?
