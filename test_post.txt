My Bf (25M) and I (25F) have been together 5 years and live together for 2 years. We both work full time and make similar salaries. He is my best friend and I love doing things with him. What I worry about is our future. He says he wants kids in the future and so do I but I know he isn’t going to be a good father and that I would most likely have to teach him everything to do while also raising kids.

I know this because we adopted a dog together about 1 1/2 years ago and that’s how it has been. I do everything and I have to teach my BF how to train the dog, I make the vet appointments, and everything else. I ask him to step up and it will last a few days, maybe a week, then things are back to the same. I am also the one that does most of the choirs, plans all our vacations, date nights, hikes, etc.

It’s been difficult because I feel like he is just happy to be in a relationship but doesn’t put much effort into it. He is a bit immature imo because he doesn’t take responsibilities seriously. This worries me about our future, getting married and starting a family. I get stressed easily and deal with anxiety so I may be overthinking it all but I imagine day 1 having a baby and he will be unable to effectively take care of me or the baby if I need him too.

I know I’m looking far in the future but I think it may be a compatibility issue between us. Is this a common reason couples would break up? Do you think it’s a deal breaker?
